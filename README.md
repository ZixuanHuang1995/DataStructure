# HOROWITZ

Basic Concepts
1. System life cycle: Requirements -> Analysis -> Design -> Refinement and Coding -> Verification
2. Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation: e.g. heap (allocating storage at run-time)
3. Algorithm Specification: Flow Chart e.g. Recursive
4. Data Abstraction: representation <--> implementation e.g. ADT
5. Performance Analysis: Space/Time Complexity (O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(2^n)), Measurment
