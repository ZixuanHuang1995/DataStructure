Basic Concepts
1. System life cycle: Requirements -> Analysis -> Design -> Refinement and Coding -> Verification
2. Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation: e.g. heap (allocating storage at run-time)
3. Algorithm Specification: Flow Chart e.g. Recursive
4. Data Abstraction: representation <--> implementation e.g. ADT
5. Performance Analysis: Space/Time Complexity (O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(2^n)), Measurment

Array: A set of pairs <index, value>

Structure/Record: A collection of data items.

Stacks and Queues

Linked Lists

Trees: Data are organized in a hierarchical manner.

Graphs: V(G), E(G) represent the sets of pairs of vertices and edges, repectively, of graph G.

Sorting: We use the term list to mean a collection of records, each record having one or more fields.

Hashing: Enables us to perform the dictionary operations search, insert and delete in O(1) expected time.
